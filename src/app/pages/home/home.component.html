        <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2014 by <a href="#">Mark</a></p>

        <p>This blog post shows a few different types of content that’s supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic
          typography, images, and code are all supported.</p>

        <p>Yeah, she dances to her own beat. Oh, no. You could've been the greatest. 'Cause, baby, <a href="#">you're a
            firework</a>. Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed. Open up your heart and just let it begin. So très
          chic, yeah, she's a classic.</p>

              is how we do it</strong>. I'm not sticking around to watch you go down. You think you're so rock and roll,
            but you're really just a joke. I know one spark will shock the world, yeah yeah. Can't replace you with a
            million rings.</p>

        <p>Trying to connect the dots, don't know what to tell my boss. Before you met me I was alright but things were
          kinda heavy. You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine. Glitter all over the room <em>pink
            flamingos</em> in the pool. </p>

        <p>I am ready for the road less traveled. Already <a href="#">brushing off the dust</a>. Yeah, you're lucky if
          you're on her plane. I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath. Uh, She’s a beast. I call her Karma (come
          back). Black ray-bans, you know she's with the band. I can't sleep let's run away and don't ever look back,
          don't ever look back.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Growing fast into a <strong>bolt of lightning</strong>. Be careful Try not to lead her on</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I'm intrigued, for a peek, heard it's fascinating. Oh oh! Wanna be a victim ready for abduction. She's got
          that international smile, oh yeah, she's got that one international smile. Do you ever feel, feel so paper
          thin. I’m gon’ put her in a coma. Sun-kissed skin so hot we'll melt your popsicle.</p>
        <p>This is transcendental, on another level, boy, you're my lucky star.</p>

        <p>From Tokyo to Mexico, to Rio. Yeah, you take me to utopia. I'm walking on air. We'd make out in your Mustang
          to Radiohead. I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one. Sun-kissed skin so hot we'll melt your popsicle.
          Slow cooking pancakes for my boy, still up, still fresh as a Daisy.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I hope you got a healthy appetite.</li>
          <li>You're never gonna be unsatisfied.</li>
          <li>Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Don't need apologies. Boy, you're an alien your touch so foreign, it's <em>supernatural</em>,
          extraterrestrial. Talk about our future like we had a clue. I can feel a phoenix inside of me.</p>
